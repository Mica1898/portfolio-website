**Title: PORTFOLIO**

**DESCRIPTION**
My portfolio project! I learned that (max-width: 100%, padding-top, padding-bottom) is better to space flex containers rather then using margin. I also learned how to make an iframe responsive.

**Roadmap For Future Improvements**
I am planning to fix some of the containers by giving them a max-width to prevent the excessive flexing. I would like to update the projects a different variety of languages/frameworks instead of JavaScript based.
